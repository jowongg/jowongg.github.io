            1. The two articles both articulate an ethical problem related to their topic 
            (industry-standard design tools & the current scale and state of open-source tech). 
            Define what you consider to be the authors positions in relation to these two topics and 
            how they overlap. What connections can you draw between these two articles? Do they prescribe 
            solutions that are pertinent to each other? 
            </h3>
            <p>
            In the article The programmed designer, Hartnett discussed the designer's loss of power over design 
            tools due to the hegemony of industry-standard design tools (Adobe and Apple). Meanwhile, Mueller underlined 
            the concern of the descending autonomy of coders in capitalism and open-source tech becoming big companies' 
            property in his article Microsoft and the Yeoman Coders. Both authors stand in defending the freedom and 
            values of artisans, in other words, we graphic designers and code writers. These two articles alert the 
            audiences about the unhealthy environments in both industries, which are surprisingly similar. Graphic 
            designers' survival depends on tools that are not owned by them but by private corporations. Code writers 
            gradually losing the community that provides sharing and learning opportunities due to the purchase by big 
            companies. The freedom of these artisans is reducing and their fate is in the hands of the enterprises. 
            Luckily, the authors list solutions to solve these obstacles. For graphic designers, we need to search or 
            create tools that are open sources and not owned by Adobe or Apple, such as paper.js, to decrease our 
            reliance on tools that are not in our control. Updating and mastering the method of creation is the key to 
            fight against the industry-standard process. Moreover, we can also take advice from Mueller to keep monitor 
            and prosper the user's community of small trustworthy tools such as procreate, blender, and clip studio paint. 
            For code writers, instead of building decentralization, we should preserve the user community of small 
            trustworthy companies/platforms to ensure the freedom of sharing codes. Hartnett's suggestions are also 
            useful for code writers that coder could build their own platforms or website to share their codes to 
            prevent the hegemony of code's knowledge.

            2. Aside from the mastery of certain digital tools and programs, what skills do you see as integral to 
            your graphic design practice?
            </h3>
            <p>
            Aside from learning digitals such as photoshop and illustrator, I think knowing different mediums to 
            design (e.g. coding, Arduino, drawing, 3D modeling) is integral to my graphic practice. I believe that 
            mere practices in one medium (such as adobe suite) do not satisfy the needs of the industry or my own 
            aesthetic pursuit. With multiple mediums, the artistic potential of an artwork would be expanded into 
            surprising visual effects, such as emerging a 3D model with a poster design and using code and mechanicals 
            to create interactive art (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV8v2GKC8WA&t=297s). Understanding different 
            mediums does not just elaborate the forms of expressing art, but also learning a whole new mindset to create 
            art. It would provide different strategies for me when I am working on an art piece, and viewing other art 
            from new perspectives. With mixing and matching different mediums to design, maybe someday in the future 
            I could make some brand new things.

            1. What do you think of Lialina's definition of the universal user? Do you think it is a useful category 
            for understanding Schwulst's argument advocating for individual websites over platforms? Explain why and 
            provide at least 1 example. 
            </h3>
            <p>
            The definition of the universal user from Lialina would be people who understand the functionalities of 
            applications and are capable to control them in their desire. I think we should reflect upon our behavior 
            with using computers as they are heavily involved in our daily lives nowadays. It is critical that we as 
            users should obtain some knowledge about the logic behind the application and coding in order to avoid us 
            getting "controlled" or limit by the computers. This supports the argument of Schwulst that we should build 
            our own website to explore our ability and creativity with computers, instead of having websites that look 
            the same as others on the internet, for example, Wix and Shopify. Both of these frameworks provides convenient 
            functions for users to build their website with ease, yet they follow the same pattern. Same layouts, same icons, 
            same structures, etc, are all limiting users' ability to use their full creative potential to build their own 
            space on the internet. However, with some knowledge of HTML and coding language, we could create a website with 
            a much deeper diversity and creativity.

            2. What kind of computer user are you? Draw on concepts from Lialina's text, and integrate a quotation in your answer.

            I think I am "[s]uch users will find a way to their aspiration without an app or utility programmed specifically for 
            it" on the internet. I know what I want and try to find a way to achieve it. At the same time, I also treat the internet 
            as a bookshelf that I could customize with personal elements. For example, Wix was a place that I customize with pictures 
            and styles before learning HTML. It was satisfying to have a place on the internet that was just owned by myself.

            A key part to generative design and code is pattern and routine. Akin to a chess player, marking each move down, 
            and keeping a trace of your decisions can prove useful for your own process and future making. As a designer, to know 
            that there might be a variety of possibilities to a given situation, can aid our ways of observing by using tools in novel 
            ways. In one series of work, Van Rossum looks to fundamentals of waveforms as a departure point and reference point for 
            connecting an interface to affecting the parameters of a letterform. If the letters explode, so too would the speakers. 
            Find 1 unique example of a pattern in nature, that appears to be programmatic. Post a visual of this pattern and describe 
            how it is programmatic in nature.

            <p>
            We all know that our year starts off with freezing winter, then processes into warm spring as well as hot summer, and ends 
            with snowy days. This behavior is due to the pattern of the earth's self-rotation that the sphere would be hit by the sun-ray 
            at different angles throughout the year. This causes the above graphic, the warmest color at the center gradually expand into the 
            coldest color. However, the graphic is distinct in that every city contains various portions of colors compared to one another due to their 
            geographical location. This is like inputting a variable into a program (which is the self-rotation of the earth). In addition to the 
            variety of this variable, cities in the southern sphere create contrasting temperature graphics.
            </p>
            <p>
            This indicates the programmatic relationship between the locations, the weather, and the self-rotation of the earth. The locations 
            are input values in the program of self-rotation, which outputs the result in weather differences. Moreover, these graphs would be 
            slightly different every year as there are random factors (such as climate change and different amounts of sun-ray) that exist in the 
            program, just like randomness in generative art.

            A major theme that runs throughout Steyerl's essay is that of surveillance. In your own words, define surveillance and discuss how the 
            notion of a “vertical” or aerial perspective lends itself to a culture of surveillance according to Steyerl's thought experiment.  
            </h3>
            <p>
            In my understanding, surveillance contains a lot of meanings. It could be an intruder of one's privacy. It could represent an assurance 
            of safety. It could also become the witness of justice. Although it works in various functions, they all have common characteristics, which 
            is to see without being known. The advancement of technology and perspective enhances the existence of surveillance in our society. The god-eye 
            view of aerial perspective allows the audience floating on a virtual plane in the sky and gaze at objects on the ground. It is a one-way looking 
            from top to down, which suits the needs of seeing without being known. Moreover, the position of looking from the top intensified the relation of 
            power and classes, as the perspective is distanced and superior to the ground, creating an illusion of observing. These factors contribute to the 
            culture of surveillance and the connotation behind it as the vertical perspective empowers people to see everything superiorly but get their identity 
            hidden. Even though the ground is just a virtual ground in devices, people are gradually forgetting this fact and carry the illusion to 
            continue their gazes.
