            <h2>Reflection on Article</h2>
            <p>In the article The programmed designer, Hartnett discussed the designer's loss of power over design tools 
                due to the hegemony of industry-standard design tools (Adobe and Apple). Meanwhile, Mueller underlined the concern 
                of the descending autonomy of coders in capitalism and open-source tech becoming big companies' property in his 
                article Microsoft and the Yeoman Coders. Both authors stand in defending the freedom and values of artisans, in other 
                words, we graphic designers and code writers. These two articles alert the audiences about the unhealthy environments 
                in both industries, which are surprisingly similar. Graphic designers' survival depends on tools that are not owned by 
                them but by private corporations. Code writers gradually losing the community that provides sharing and learning opportunities 
                due to the purchase by big companies. The freedom of these artisans is reducing and their fate is in the hands of the enterprises. 
                Luckily, the authors list solutions to solve these obstacles. For graphic designers, we need to search or create tools that are 
                open sources and not owned by Adobe or Apple, such as paper.js, to decrease our reliance on tools that are not in our control. 
                Updating and mastering the method of creation is the key to fight against the industry-standard process. Moreover, 
                we can also take advice from Mueller to keep monitor and prosper the user's community of small trustworthy tools such 
                as procreate, blender, and clip studio paint. For code writers, instead of building decentralization, we should preserve the 
                user community of small trustworthy companies/platforms to ensure the freedom of sharing codes. Hartnett's suggestions are also 
                useful for code writers that coder could build their own platforms or website to share their codes to prevent the hegemony of code's knowledge.</p>
            <h2>My vision</h2>
            <p>Aside from learning digitals such as photoshop and illustrator, I think knowing different mediums to design 
                (e.g. coding, Arduino, drawing, 3D modeling) is integral to my graphic practice. I believe that mere practices in 
                one medium (such as adobe suite) do not satisfy the needs of the industry or my own aesthetic pursuit. With multiple mediums, 
                the artistic potential of an artwork would be expanded into surprising visual effects, such as emerging a 3D model with a poster 
                design and using code and mechanicals to create interactive art (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV8v2GKC8WA&t=297s). Understanding 
                different mediums does not just elaborate the forms of expressing art, but also learning a whole new mindset to create art. It would 
                provide different strategies for me when I am working on an art piece, and viewing other art from new perspectives. With mixing and 
                matching different mediums to design, maybe someday in the future I could make some brand new things.
