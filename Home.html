                <h2>Hi! I am Joycelyn and I am a first-year student in Graphic Design.<br> 
                    I have learnt to program since grade 11 and I mostly programmed in c#<br>
                    on console. I had created a console form 'online shop' and 'album base'<br>
                    which consist classes, overriding classes function, loading and exporting information etc.<br> 
                    Since console was the only coding platform for me in the past,<br>
                    I do not have much experience with HTML/CSS. This course would be an<br> 
                    interesting challenge for me!

                For the beginning of this semester, I am exploring forms<br> 
                with folding paper, which is fairly interesting as involving<br> 
                in a process of making 2D form into 3D forms allows me to<br> 
                understand the relationship of structure and graphic. Also,<br>
                I really enjoy the process of creating illustrative graphic<br> 
                for my website as I could engage in the knowledge of UI/UX and<br> 
                illustration. In my daily life, I love to explore photography,<br> 
                especially with film, as it is amazing to use retro and vintage things<br> 
                to experience the life in the past.

            <p id="codingtext">This website is a really tough challenge since I am used to move things around with my mouse instead of coding them to move. <br>
           I also met difficulties on designing the webpage and coding functions that I wanted to be incorporated in the design. <br>
           Throughout the process, I realised graphic details such as margin within the website actually consist a lot of effort and refining. <br>
           This project enhances my mindset as a designer and knowledge on HTML/CSS structure. </p>
