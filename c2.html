            <h3>Exploration and experimentation #1-11,19,20 </h3>
            <p>
            (Work counted from left to right, top to bottom) During this assignment, I spent the majority of the time exploring the codes and variations that I could 
            work in p5.js, as this is an entirely new world to me. I learnt how to code iteration, animation, randomness, 
            noise, photographic effects, blend modes, textToPoints(), using an external library, inputting mouse or slider 
            value 3D space, and image processing. I also researched tutorials and other codes (which are all cited in the codes) 
            to apply to my work. At the beginning of a sketch, I usually did not have a clear idea and just coded randomly to see 
            what would be created. Then if I was satisfied with the result, I would keep refining the work. For instance, in sketch #5, 
            I just learnt textToPoint() and combine it with circles, which drew out an aesthetically pleasing and refined B. I then 
            adjusted the size of the circles, sample factor, and colors to create the best image out of the experiment.

            <h3>Strategy: Modification and Integration #12-18,21  </h3>
            <p>
            In this stage, I started to modify and integrate my codes from the experimental stages. This helped me 
            to broaden my perspective on coding and design that a little modification can lead to a wholly different result. 
            For example, I modified sketch #5 to create sketch #13 in a 3D space. Although the code is very similar, the 
            outcome of sketch #13 is so different that it possesses the characteristic of chaos which contrasts with the confined 
            images of sketch #5. Integration is also an important lesson I learnt during this stage. It teaches me that coding sometimes 
            is not just boring math, but also unpredictable and surprising math. I integrated codes from sketches #18 and #20 to create sketch #21. 
            The integration of the codes produced a unique sketch where it looked like a billboard formed by thousands of led lights form yet a 
            little bit skewed. It was totally beyond my expectations.

            <h3>Conclusion </h3>
            <p>
           With daily practice of creative codes, I was able to build my skills gradually and understand the beauty in it. It 
           renews my view on codes. I thought coding is just a tool to execute commands, but it is more than that. It enables us 
           to create art that could be rarely done by hand. It provides another dimension of aesthetics. Math is not just algebra 
           on paper but brushes to paint. This has profoundly influenced my aesthetic and perspective on art and graphic design. I 
           am no longer limited to traditional design and use what I see in generative art and apply it to my practices. It is exciting that my 
           mindset kept broadening and filled with new aspects of art. I could say that after this process my art world is flipped.
