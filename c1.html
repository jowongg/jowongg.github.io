            During the first week, I explored different software or website that are not intended for 
            design-use such as LucidChart, http://yurafuca.com/, and PowerPoint to experiment how I could 
            create aesthetic and meaningful work under an unusual working environment. I knew that I did not want 
            to work with fragments nor collage(screenshots), but one completed graphic. Out of these programs, 
            I decided to work with LucidChart for my project. LucidChart enables me to have a high level of freedom 
            and control over creating graphics, yet some limitations (e.g. arrangement of lines between bubbles) on design, 
            leading to an interesting visual effect that could only be made with this software.
