            During the first week, I explored different software or website that are not intended for 
            design-use such as LucidChart, http://yurafuca.com/, and PowerPoint to experiment how I could 
            create aesthetic and meaningful work under an unusual working environment. I knew that I did not want 
            to work with fragments nor collage(screenshots), but one completed graphic. Out of these programs, 
            I decided to work with LucidChart for my project. LucidChart enables me to have a high level of freedom 
            and control over creating graphics, yet some limitations (e.g. arrangement of lines between bubbles) on design, 
            leading to an interesting visual effect that could only be made with this software.

            In the second week, I had a clear intention on the purpose of my work, which is 
            illustrating my struggle to reply to an overwhelming number of messages under the pandemic. 
            The red bubbles in the design represent notification. They are formed as a cluster representing the 
            tension and stress when I don't reply to messages and just let them pile up. I made little pixel black 
            hands in http://pixelartmaker.com/ and added to the composition just to vary the visual elements as well as 
            enhancing the tension.

            <p>
            During the third week, I had created different compositions without changing the main structure of the 
            cluster. I added a ”Do not disturb” bubble in the middle of the cluster for most of the experimental composition 
            to vary the message and enhance visual connotation. It allows the audience to understand that red bubbles are 
            representing notification, as well as creating room for interpretation of my design. For the third one, I experimented 
            with typographic-alike composition, but most of the comments said the text behind the cluster was somewhat distracting. 
            Therefore, I chose the first composition to develop instead of the third one.
