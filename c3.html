            When I first heard about the assignment, my first initial thought was to reflect my long-last 
            feeling about time - time is always here, but I cannot feel it. I know it is important, it is sacred, 
            it is deep, but when I look at the clock ticking to another second, seconds become minutes, I am still 
            the same. I also have another major feeling about time, which is heavy. My heart always drops thinking 
            about time profoundly. Time is such an abstract concept yet used to rule our lives. It is at the same 
            time the foundation of our whole human civilization. Time has held so many meanings for us.
            </p>
            <p>
            With all these mixed feelings, I tried to create a physical artifact that could contain all my emotions 
            and present them to the audience. An idea came when I was almost asleep, that is a chain dress. I have 
            always wanted to create a dress made up of irregular materials as I was influenced by the tv show 
            Project runways. I figured out how to fit in my emotions in symbolizing through links and the medium 
            of chains (details would be shown below).

            <p>
            During the group presentation, I presented my idea through Miro and was suggested to create another 
            artifact such as a booklet to explain my concept and feelings. I have chosen three main theme to 
            explore in my dress.
            <p>
            Time is unnoticeable. 
            </p>
            <p>
            A day is easily passed without any feeling of passing. We wake up, do things, sleep, and 
            the day is gone. Just another day, like putting up one link per day doesn't change much too. 
            But when days turn into weeks, weeks turn into months, months turn into years, and we look back, 
            time becomes visible - the dress is so different with the accumulation of links. Time is felt.
            </p>
            <p>
            Time is heavy.
            </p>
            <p>
            Time might be a heavy burden. A burden that everyone needs to live with. Yet, with time, we can build 
            relationships, learn knowledge, establish our identities, become mature, gain experiences...The more time 
            passes, the heavier our “things” are. We continuously have more with time flowing. Time blessed us 
            with heavy gifts.
            </p>
            <p>
            Time shapes our lives.
            </p>
            <p>
            When we put up a link, we would make little decision of where to put it up. On top? In the middle? Or sideways? 
            These small decisions would shape the future form of the dress. Our everyday decisions like drinking coffee, 
            exercising, and meeting friends also form how our lives would be.

            I started making the dress and created the first draft of the booklet. As I have a clear goal and mindset, 
            I did not encounter many obstacles in terms of creating the dress. However, when I came to design the booklet, 
            I lost my direction as I thought it was too simple - black on white, no graphic at all. I tried to add in different 
            elements, and they did not work. I then got suggestions from my professors, for instance, adding links in motifs and 
            using curves to define information hierarchy. All of them were in the last version of my concept cards (I decided to 
            create cards instead of a booklet). I also decided to create a package including the cards, links, and a plier 
            for the user.

            <p>
            After the class presentation, I received advice to refine the stroke weight of the links motif. 
            However, I tried a few variations and the original one was the best fit. I also bought some photography set 
            up to document my artifacts to maximize the visual.
